This repository contains the material for my course

**Market Analysis with Econometrics and Machine Learning**

taught by Sebastian Kranz at Ulm University. The course was adapted during the Corona Crisis as an open online course and has many interactive elements.

### Shiny apps with videos and quizzes

For an illustration of the course take a look at the shiny app with videos and quizes for the first section 1a:

### Interactive RTutor problem sets

Each section also has an interactive RTutor problem set where you work yourself through the material in R. You can automatically check your solutions and get hints. You can solve the RTutor problem sets on your own computer (explained further below) on the rstudio cloud:

### Course content

The course consists of the following 3 chapters.

**Chapter 1** directly starts with an example illustrating why historical sales data may yield very misleading results if we want to estimate a demand function for a product. We then work through the econometric background focusing on endogeniety problems and approaches for estimating causal effects. Here are the links to the video quiz shiny apps:

**Chapter 2** contrasts econometric modelling with the typical machine learning approach and covers some prediction algorithms like random forests. We discuss which questions can be well treated as classical prediction problems and in which situations good prediction accuracy on a test data set may not be a relevant criterion for the actual question we are interested in. We also illustrate causal forests which is a novel method to identify heterogenous causal effects in experiments.
